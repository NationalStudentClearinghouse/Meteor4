# Here are the parameters that are necessary

# Here are the values that must be set:

# Do you want to sign your assertions?
# If not then make this value "No"
# Realize that in a production environment
# everyone will probably require a signed 
# assertion.  So if you don't sign yours
# then you probably won't get any data
# Only change this to "No" when you know 
# that the entity you are communicating
# with does not require the assertion to 
# be signed
#authentication.signassertion=No
authentication.signassertion=Yes

# This should probably not change
# unless you really know what you are doing
authentication.keystore.type=JKS

# This is the path to the actual keystore that
# holds the private key.  Be careful where you
# put this file.  Under no circumstances should
# you put the keystore in a location that is accessible
# to the web!!!!!
